# Martin Hutchinson

Hi, I'm Martin. I'm a software engineer working on transparency.
I'm a core maintainer of Google Certificate Tranparency logs,
[Trillian](https://github.com/google/trillian), and many of the
libraries under [transparency-dev](https://github.com/transparency-dev).

I'm the author of the [Claimant Model](https://transparency.dev/how-to-design-a-verifiable-system/),
which is a framework for understanding and communicating about transparency solutions.

My recent focus has been on writing and launching [Trillian Tessera](https://github.com/transparency-dev/trillian-tessera).

## Recent Projects

### Transparency.dev Days

I kickstarted and helped organize the first [Tranparency.dev Days](https://blog.transparency.dev/transparencydev-summit-recap).

### Witnessing

We created a [log witness](https://github.com/transparency-dev/witness) that can be easily deployed. This is the
[armored witness](https://github.com/transparency-dev/armored-witness), a hardware device that
uses secure boot to provide a tamper-proof witness solution.
This uses the [checkpoint distributor](https://github.com/transparency-dev/distributor) as a way
to make available the witnessed checkpoints.
