# Martin Hutchinson

Hi, I'm Martin. I'm a software engineer working on transparency.
I'm a core maintainer of Google Certificate Tranparency logs, [Trillian](https://github.com/google/trillian), [Tessera](https://github.com/transparency-dev/tessera), and many of the libraries under [transparency-dev](https://github.com/transparency-dev).
I also maintain a number of the [C2SP transparency specs](https://c2sp.org).

I'm the author of the [Claimant Model](https://transparency.dev/how-to-design-a-verifiable-system/), which is a framework for understanding and communicating about transparency solutions.

My core projects for 2025 have been:
  - [Tessera](https://github.com/transparency-dev/tessera): design, development, and launch to GA.
  - [Verifiable Index](https://github.com/transparency-dev/incubator/vindex): design, and develop prototype
  - [Transparency.dev Summit 2025](https://transparency.dev/summit2025/): co-chair for the Program Committee

## Recent Projects

### Transparency.dev Days

I kickstarted and helped organize the first [Tranparency.dev Days](https://blog.transparency.dev/transparencydev-summit-recap).

### Witnessing

We created a [log witness](https://github.com/transparency-dev/witness) that can be easily deployed.
This is the [armored witness](https://github.com/transparency-dev/armored-witness), a hardware device that uses secure boot to provide a tamper-proof witness solution.
This uses the [checkpoint distributor](https://github.com/transparency-dev/distributor) as a way to make available the witnessed checkpoints.

### Woodpecker

[Woodpecker](https://github.com/mhutchinson/woodpecker) is a Transparency Log inspector.
Primarily aimed at initial investigation of a new log, it allows the user to view leaves in most deployed transparency logs.
